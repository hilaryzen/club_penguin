    -found some constants online that i think will be helpful in the process of printing, for down the line
    -wrote basic helper functions for clearing terminal, drawing a penguin, resizing the terminal, etc

kiranV -- 2020-01-03 15:50
    -began writing helper server functions with a whole lot of help from dwsource's networking.c reference file
    -wrote utility functions for accessing/configuring semaphores in sema.c
    -wrote beginning of server main(), configuring all the necessary pieces before beginning to accept connections

kiranV -- 2020-01-04 07:52
   -finished a theoretically working server, along with signal handling for a clean exit upon ^C; largely untested because there is no working client yet

kiranV -- 2020-01-04 21:30
   -created a basic select client to send chat type messages to the server, revealed a whole lot of bugs in the server code from this morning and fixed some of them

kiranV -- 2020-01-05 09:00
   -fixed bugs surrounding ID's and identifying empty spaces in the shared memory, as well as a couple others; all seems to be working with the server structure!
   -clean(ing) up and comment(ing) code to make it not so nightmarish to read
   -remaining bugs:
       -weird interrupts when a user is in the middle of typing and a message is received
       -sockets are not closed in the main server when a user disconnects
       -still need to add shared memory for the actual game state
       -clientside print statements are weird to say the least

   -began looking through Kiran's server and planning out how to modify how chat appears on terminal
   -right now filling this out because I forgot how to set a branch upstream

almaT -- 2020-01-05 18:57
    -started creating chat log
    -issue is that i'm currently storing the chat as a text file, but my 2 clients can't access it at the same
     time bc they share the same directory (i think if it were 2 seperate computers, it would work)

almaT -- 2020-01-06 0:23
    -to try to fix aformentioned issue, created "touch_log" var in client. if multiple clients from same directory, only one
     has it set to true. issue now is only messages sent by that special client are written into the log

almaT -- 2020-01-06 10:57
    -fixed one-message issue from earlier.

almaT -- 2020-01-06 23:16
    -So username is being written to file, but it's j the username of the client that can touch the file. I guess i'm getting the
    username in the wrong place (I though writing cnx_info in process_queue would mean that messages sent from almaLisa would
    get tagged as such to almaBart, but it just seems like all messages are from almaBart)

    -created sdl branch and wrote program to open a new window and allow the user to move a penguin around
    -added separate main.c file and makefile in a folder, will work on combining this with the chat

hilaryZ -- 2020-01-09 00:58
    -added test files using ncurses to sdl_practice folder on the sdl branch
    -created layout of three windows that will contain the user's game, chat, and message being typed
    
 almaT -- 2020-01-07 
    -changed render.c and dupped so that we can write to file and print file to stdout
    
 almaT -- 2020-01-08
    -fixed the username error, now username of that who sent the message is added to log
    
 almaT -- 2020-01-09
    -started using ncurses, major windowing addition. currently have 3 box windows, working on typing in bottom chat and getting
     to print in top chat
    -current error: special characters not being caught?
  
 almaT -- 2020-01-10
    -changed window structure, made windows.c a lot more modular, got rid of boxes so no weird typing over border
    -attempted adding backspace functionality
 
 almaT -- 2020-01-10
    -noticed issue where if you type 'hey what's up' and then backspace and write 'hi', 'hiy what's up' will be sent 
 
 almaT -- 2020-01-13
    -fixed the above issue by creating 'size' variable along w the preexisting counter 'i'
    
 almaT -- 2020-01-14
    -fixed not sending whole chat bc of wrong variable sent in server
    -can switch between windows, undefined behavior if you use up and down arrow keys
