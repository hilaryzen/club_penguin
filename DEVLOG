    -found some constants online that i think will be helpful in the process of printing, for down the line
    -wrote basic helper functions for clearing terminal, drawing a penguin, resizing the terminal, etc

kiranV -- 2020-01-03 15:50
    -began writing helper server functions with a whole lot of help from dwsource's networking.c reference file
    -wrote utility functions for accessing/configuring semaphores in sema.c
    -wrote beginning of server main(), configuring all the necessary pieces before beginning to accept connections

kiranV -- 2020-01-04 07:52
   -finished a theoretically working server, along with signal handling for a clean exit upon ^C; largely untested because there is no working client yet

kiranV -- 2020-01-04 21:30
   -created a basic select client to send chat type messages to the server, revealed a whole lot of bugs in the server code from this morning and fixed some of them

kiranV -- 2020-01-05 09:00
   -fixed bugs surrounding ID's and identifying empty spaces in the shared memory, as well as a couple others; all seems to be working with the server structure!
   -clean(ing) up and comment(ing) code to make it not so nightmarish to read
   -remaining bugs:
       -weird interrupts when a user is in the middle of typing and a message is received
       -sockets are not closed in the main server when a user disconnects
       -still need to add shared memory for the actual game state
       -clientside print statements are weird to say the least

   -began looking through Kiran's server and planning out how to modify how chat appears on terminal
   -right now filling this out because I forgot how to set a branch upstream

almaT -- 2020-01-05 18:57
    -started creating chat log
    -issue is that im testing on homer, bart and lisa (homer is server, others are clients). i'm currently storing the
     chat as a text file, but my 2 clients can't access it at the same time bc they share the same directory (i think if
     it were 2 seperate computers, it would work). is this just screaming shared mem? i guess if it's on the same computer.
     I should implement some sort of check that decides

almaT -- 2020-01-06 0:23
    -to try to fix aformentioned issue, created "touch_log" var in client. if multiple clients from same directory, only one
     has it set to true. issue now is only messages sent by that special client are written into the log

almaT -- 2020-01-06 10:57
    -fixed one-message issue from earlier.
    -NOTE TO SELF: started making it so cnx_info is sent to client too, so you can see who sent which message.
     note that i just put write(SHM[i].sd, &cnx_info, sizeof( struct cnx_header)); in process_queue; issue is cnx_info isn't passed
     from main function to process_queue; so pass it? or make client send it? not suer which to choose (b/c they'd be sending their info
     every time they send a message when we keep that info the second they make a connection

almaT -- 2020-01-06 23:16
    -So username is being written to file, but it's j the username of the client that can touch the file. I guess i'm getting the
    username in the wrong place (I though writing cnx_info in process_queue would mean that messages sent from almaLisa would
    get tagged as such to almaBart, but it just seems like all messages are from almaBart)

hilaryZ -- 2020-01-08 01:31
    -created sdl branch and wrote program to open a new window and allow the user to move a penguin around
    -added separate main.c file and makefile in a folder, will work on combining this with the chat
