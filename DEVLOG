    -found some constants online that i think will be helpful in the process of printing, for down the line
    -wrote basic helper functions for clearing terminal, drawing a penguin, resizing the terminal, etc

    -began writing helper server functions with a whole lot of help from dwsource's networking.c reference file
    -wrote utility functions for accessing/configuring semaphores in sema.c
    -wrote beginning of server main(), configuring all the necessary pieces before beginning to accept connections

   -finished a theoretically working server, along with signal handling for a clean exit upon ^C; largely untested because there is no working client yet

   -created a basic select client to send chat type messages to the server, revealed a whole lot of bugs in the server code from this morning and fixed some of them

kiranV -- 2020-01-05 09:00
   -fixed bugs surrounding ID's and identifying empty spaces in the shared memory, as well as a couple others; all seems to be working with the server structure!
   -clean(ing) up and comment(ing) code to make it not so nightmarish to read

   -began looking through Kiran's server and planning out how to modify how chat appears on terminal
   -right now filling this out because I forgot how to set a branch upstream
